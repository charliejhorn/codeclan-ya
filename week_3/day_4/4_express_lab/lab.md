Your express application should have a single route - `/orders`.

Your pulbic JS files should contain an array of order objects with at least the following properties:
* customer_name
* order_date
* quantity

And any other relevant properties such as:
* book_title/game_title
* food_topping
* description


Provide the following functionality in the web app:

* List all orders

### Extensions

* Style the app using CSS.

### Advanced Extensions

* Add a form and functionality to add an order to the list.

### Styling

Create a css folder in the public folder and add your style.css file there.

Then add the following line inside the <HEAD> tag of your HTML pages.

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```
