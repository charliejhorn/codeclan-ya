            <h2>Your Task</h2>

            <p>You are a freelancer software developer and you need to create a form to collect information from
                potential
                clients who would like to request a quote for some work. In order to help you judge the complexity and
                time
                requirements, and give an accurate quote, you have set a series of questions to assess the work.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Create a new folder for your homework called 'Forms Homework'.</li>
                <li>Inside the 'Forms Homework' folder create two files:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>index.html</li>
                    <li>style.css</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Create a form that contains the following:</li>
                <ul>
                    <Li>Three Input fields for:</Li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Full Name (Should accept text)</li>

                        <li>Phone Number (Should accept a number and not text)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <Li>A small list of job-types that allows the user to select one option (e.g. Web Site / Mobile App
                        / UX
                        consultancy).
                    </Li>
                    <li>A checklist of features they are looking for where the user can select more than one (e.g. Home
                        Page, Contact Form, Booking System, Shopping Cart, Form, Chatbot)
                    </li>
                    <Li>A submit Button</Li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Additional Exercises</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A dropdown menu that allows the user to select their location from a selection of options (Include 3
                    or 4 options, such as Scotland/England/Wales/Ireland)
                </li>
                <Li>
                    A text area for the client to describe the work to be done.
                </Li>
                <li>
                    Add styling of your choice to your form.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hints</h3>

            <p>
                We have covered some basic form elements in class, however, <em>you will need to do some further
                    research</em> into elements we have not covered, as well as the other types that can be used with
                the
                elements we discussed earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                What other types can an input have? How can we incorporate some of them into relevant fields?
            </p>
