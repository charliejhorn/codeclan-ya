- in terminal:
  
  - run `npm install`

# Planning

- Decided to brainstorm the extent of the project and all possibilities

- Selected the features that I thought I would be able to implement within the timeframe

- Used KanBan board to track tasks

# Wireframes

- I used an Obsidian plugin called Excalidraw to produce these wireframes

# SEO

- used a `h1` on home page, 'Your Personalised Travel Bucket List', to target 'travel' and 'bucket list'

- optimised site for mobile

- if I was to launch this as a project, every destination would be using the backlink format of `bucketbounds.com/destinations/<name>`
  
  - this would ensure that it is clear where every destination page is located within the sitemap

- ensured there are no broken links on the site

# UX & Accessibility

- **UI Patterns:** 
  
  - 'Bucket Bounds' logo links to home page
  
  - Bottom navigation bar on small screen widths. follows design pattern on many modern apps

- developed using a 'mobile first' mindset, shown through the majority of wireframes being for mobile

- used Google Material icons - render as a font rather than an image (faster)

- pages are consistent through breakpoints
