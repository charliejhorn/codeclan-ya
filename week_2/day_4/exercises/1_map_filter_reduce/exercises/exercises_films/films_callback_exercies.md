### Films: Array functions exercise 

You have been given a project with two classes, `Cinema` and `Film`, and their corresponding test files.

A Film has:

- a title
- a genre
- a year
- a length

A Cinema has:

- an array of `Film`s

You need to complete the tests and make them pass, they already have a description of what the test is looking for. 

This exercise is as much about your ability to interrogate documentation as it is about familiarising yourself with how array enumerator functions and callbacks work. 

The recommend resource would be the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), although don't feel like you must limit yourself to this website if you are more comfortable with other sources. 

You should use JavaScript's built-in enumerator methods, there will be an applicable enumerator function for each of the questions in this exercise.
