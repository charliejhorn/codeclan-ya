# Traveller: Array functions exercise 

You have been given a project with two classes, `Traveller` and `Journey`, and their corresponding test files.

A `Journey` has:

- a start location
- an end location
- a mode of transport
- a distance in miles

A `Traveller` has:

- an array of Journeys

You need to have all the tests passing by adding the functionality to classes already provided. The tests have already been done for you. 

This exercise is as much about your ability to interrogate documentation as it is about familiarising yourself with how array enumerator functions and callbacks work. 

The recommend resource would be the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), although don't feel like you must limit yourself to this website if you are more comfortable with other sources.
